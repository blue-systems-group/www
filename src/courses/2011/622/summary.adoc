== Summary

This course is intended to be an introduction to systems research for more
advanced graduate students. Our goal is to attempt to give students an
introduction to the research process: identifying and investigating a
research question, and rapidly prototyping a novel computer system. The
course is structured around a student-proposed group project and class time
discussing systems research papers. In order to keep the class a manageable
size, the course is capped at around 20 students.
