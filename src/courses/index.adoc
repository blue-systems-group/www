*Teaching is an integral part of link:/[blue's] mission.* We enjoy the chance
to introduce students to the elegance of computer systems as well as the
opportunity to work with more experienced students as they continue to
develop their abilities.

We regularly teach an introduction to operating systems for advanced
undergraduates and beginning graduate students and a small seminar designed
for Ph.D. students that explores rotating contemporary topics in modern
mobile systems. Our undergraduate operating systems course uses the
link:/projects/opsclass[ops-class.org instructional operating systems
framework] our group has built to automate testing and simplify assignment
submission. The course also benefits from the contributions of multiple
volunteers each year--who we refer to as ninjas--who give back to the class
by assisting the next generation of students.
