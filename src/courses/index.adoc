//
*Teaching is an integral part of link:/[blue's] mission.*
//
We enjoy the chance to introduce students to the elegance of computer systems,
and the opportunity to work with experienced students as they learn more.

We regularly teach an introduction to operating systems and a seminar
exploring rotating topics in modern mobile systems.
//
Our undergraduate operating systems course uses the
link:/projects/opsclass[ops-class.org website and tools] our group has built
to automate testing and simplify assignment submission.
//
The course also benefits from the contributions of volunteers (or "ninjas")
who give back to the class by assisting the next generation of students.
//
This fall we are teaching a link:/courses/ub_199_fall_2016[new course to
freshman undergraduates on the internet] in a flipped format.
//
This is providing us with our first opportunity to experiment with
link:/projects/internetclass[learning webs].
