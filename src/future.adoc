The talk covers three projects linked by the theme of _uncertainty_: our work
on link:/projects/pocketparker[PocketParker],
link:/projects/wirelessvalidation/[VeriFi], and link:/projects/maybe[`maybe`].
//
It also briefly discusses our work to link:/projects/internetclass[create
adaptive online courses] in the context of
https://www.internet-class.org/courses/fys/syllabus[`internet-class.org`].

More specifically, the talk is broken down as follows:

. link:/projects/pocketparker[PocketParker]:

//
and
https://youtu.be/g1ap_7WuvWo?list=PLE6LEE8y2Jp-93G7d38ee91hufmUoByB9[applications

https://youtu.be/3Acp18w6lXw?list=PLE6LEE8y2Jp-93G7d38ee91hufmUoByB9[`internet-class.org`].

== Research

I am lucky to supervise multiple excellent link:/people/[Ph.D. students].
//
I have multiple exciting ongoing research projects with collaborators at the
University at Buffalo, Microsoft Research, and the University of Michigan.
//
Please peruse our link:/projects/[projects] and link:/papers/[papers] pages to
find out more.
//
I am particularly excited about our work on link:/projects/maybe[programming
uncertainty], link:/projects/wirelessvalidation[wireless protocol validation],
link:/projects/thermaplan[smartphone thermal management], and
link:/projects/qoe[smartphone quality-of-experience].
//
I would choose our link:/papers/ubicomp2014-pocketparker/[2014 UbiComp paper]
on link:/projects/pocketparker/[PocketParker], our
link:/papers/infocom2016-scans/[2016 INFOCOM paper] on
link:/projects/pocketsniffer/[crowdsourcing network monitoring], and our
link:/papers/rv2016-sniffer/[2016 RV paper] on
link:/projects/wirelessvalidation[wireless protocol validation] as three
representative publications.

== Teaching

I teach multiple large and popular courses and have made a great deal of
material available online.
//
Since joining UB I have taught a course on https://www.ops-class.org[computer
operating systems] to undergraduate and graduate students.
//
The https://www.ops-class.org/asst/overview/[assignments] and infrastructure
for this course originated at Harvard, but I have published
https://www.ops-class.org/slides/[slides],
https://www.ops-class.org/exams/[exams], and
https://www.ops-class.org/slides/[videos] for the course online, and led the
creation of https://test161.ops-class.org[new automated testing tools].

This fall I am teaching a new course on the internet to 440 incoming freshman
in a flipped format.
//
I have recorded
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk97mPCd8nvbxGGfkYkBXrSEvpTc1xTF8[hundreds
of short videos explaining key concepts], designed
https://www.internet-class.org/courses/fys/syllabus/#_description[26 new
in-class activities], and supervised 30 course staff.
//
Material for the course will eventually be available online at the
https://www.internet-class.org/[`internet-class.org`] website.
//
Please review the
https://www.internet-class.org/courses/fys/syllabus/[syllabus] to get a sense
of how the course works in practice.

link:/[This site] describes my group's link:/projects/[research projects] and
link:/courses/[teaching] activities.
//
Please peruse to find out more.

== Service

I am active as a technical program committee member and reviewer for the top
conferences and workshops in mobile systems
(https://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/[MobiSys] (2017, 2016, 2014),
http://www.hotmobile.org/main/[HotMobile] (2016),
http://mobicase.org/[MobiCASE] (2016)) and wireless sensor networks
(http://sensys.acm.org/[SenSys] (2016,2013,2012,2011),
http://ipsn.acm.org/[IPSN] (2017,2015), and http://www.ewsn.org/[EWSN]
(2013)).
//
I also regularly review submissions to journals including ACM Transactions on
http://tosn.acm.org/[Transactions on Sensor Networks (TOSN)],
http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/ton/submissions.html[IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (ToN)],
http://www.computer.org/portal/web/tmc[IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing
(TMC)], and http://www.computer.org/portal/web/tpds[IEEE Transactions on
Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS)].

In 2015 link:/posts/2015-05-20-why-im-editing-a-getmobile-colu/[I began
editing a column] for http://www.sigmobile.org/pubs/getmobile/[GetMobile
Magazine].
//
The column attempts to connect past developments with future trends in mobile
systems.
//
If you have any idea for a submission, please get in touch.

At UB I led an overhaul of our undergraduate computer science curriculum.
//
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~hartloff/index.html[Jesse Hartloff] and I also
designed a https://goo.gl/brdQOO[new series of introductory courses].

I am also involved in efforts to try and improve diversity within computer
science.
//
With help from
https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/math/about-us/our-alumni/our-alumni.host.html/content/shared/cas/math/modules/our-alumni/n-sanford.detail.html[Natasha
Sanford] and later http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~gelarehm/[Gela Malek Pour],
in 2014 I helped start a https://www.facebook.com/ubscientista/[UB chapter]
of the http://www.scientistafoundation.com/[Scientista Foundation] which
promotes female participation in STEM.
//
Our local chapter is focused on women in computer science and, with the help
of generous support from http://www.bloomberg.com[Bloomberg], has held a
series of successful events on campus bringing attention to this important
issue.
//
I also organized donations to create a diversity in computer science mural,
link:/people/challen@buffalo.edu/mural.jpg[this iconic photo] of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper[Grace Hopper] now adorns the wall
outside our lab.

== Biography

I lead the link:/[blue Systems Research Group] and also direct the
http://www.phone-lab.org[PhoneLab].
//
My research interests are in systems and networking, mobile systems, and
smartphones.
//
I teach an https://www.ops-class.org[introduction to computer operating
systems], a http://www.internet-class.org[new freshman course on the
internet], and a link:/courses/ub-720-fall-2016/[graduate seminar] covering a
variety of contemporary topics in mobile systems.
