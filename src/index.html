    <h2>blue is a Systems Research Group</h2>

    <p class="lead">
    We design, build, and evaluate novel computer systems. We are currently
    working on smartphones, today's most pervasive mobile technology. Our
    research aims to make smartphones more useful, safer, and more sustainable.
    But at <a href="/">blue</a> we put people first. Our primary mission is to
    train computer scientists and our primary product is people. We try to align
    everything else in service of that goal, which results in putting
    <strong>people before projects before papers.</strong> And being awesome.

    <p>
    <strong>Putting people first</strong> reflects the fact that as an
    academic research group <a href="/">blue's</a> primary purpose is to
    train future researchers and developers. Lab members are in school and
    are here to learn. When conducting research, our objective is to allow
    students the chance to come up with new ideas, develop them into
    prototype systems, evaluate them objectively, and then communicate their
    results effectively to the broader scientific community. Along the way
    they are developing analytical skills and leadership abilities they
    benefiting the majority of their career in technology that occurs
    <i>after</i> they leave <a href="/">blue</a>.

    </h3>

    <p>
    Putting <strong>people before projects</strong> means allowing <a
      href="/">blue</a> group members to choose and lead projects that excite
    them and letting projects proceed at a pace that benefits members' personal
    development. We utilize our freedom as an academic research lab to identify
    novel directions that we are excited about pursuing without the
    constraints of a company or industrial research lab. But along the way we
    are careful not to miss opportunities to allow <a href="/">blue</a> group
    members to learn and grow as they develop their projects&mdash;even if
    this means development doesn't always happen as fast as possible.

    <p>
    Putting <strong>projects before papers</strong> allows us to work on
    projects that interest us&mdash;not just ones that might quickly lead to
    a publication&mdash;and to publish when ready. While acceptance rates at
    many systems conferences are low enough to be discouraging, we believe
    that publishing should be a fundamentally happy undertaking. It's our
    chance to share what we've found with the world outside our group, and to
    celebrate the hard work and growth of <a href="/">blue</a> members. We
    also don't work on projects because we need to publish papers&mdash;we
    work on projects because we love building things and we're curious about
    what will happen when we try something new. </p>

    <h2>Together In the Lab</h2>

    <p>
    <a href="/">blue</a> is fortunate to have a single lab large enough to
    house all current group members&mdash;currently
    <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/buildings/building?id=davis">Davis Hall</a>
    Room 301B, also know as the PhoneLab. Inspired by the organization of
    groups like the Berkeley
    <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/">AMP Lab</a>,
    as well as the organization of typical startups and technology
    companies, all group members&mdash;faculty, administrators, graduate students and
    undergraduates&mdash;work side-by-side in our lab. This arrangement
    allows for spontaneous real-time collaboration and problem solving while
    also building a sense of camaraderie. Group members are asked to be
    present in the lab during certain hours to facilitate interaction. New <a
      href="/">blue</a> members find it easy to get started since there are
    always more experienced developers nearby, and many discussions
    that take place in the lab have benefited from being overheard by group
    members that were not directly engaged in the project. It also just ends
    up being a lot of fun!
