    <!---->
    We design, build, and evaluate novel computer systems.
    <!---->
    We are currently working on smartphones, today's most pervasive mobile
    technology.
    <!---->
    Our research aims to make smartphones more useful, safer, and more
    sustainable.
    <!---->
    But our primary goal is training computer scientists and our primary
    product is people.
    <!---->
    We try to align everything in service of that goal, which results in
    putting <strong>people before projects before papers.</strong>

    <strong>Putting people first.</strong>
    <!---->
    Our primary job is training future researchers and developers.
    <!---->
    Lab members are here to learn.
    <!---->
    Students come up with new ideas, develop prototype systems, evaluate
    them, and then communicate their results to the broader scientific
    community.
    <!---->
    Along the way they are developing analytical and leadership abilities to
    bootstrap a successful career in technology.

    <!---->
    <strong>Putting people before projects.</strong>
    <!---->
    Group members choose and lead projects that excite them.
    <!---->
    Projects proceed at a pace that benefits members' personal development.
    <!---->
    Along the way, we are careful not to miss opportunities to allow group
    members to learn and grow.
    <!---->
    Sometimes this means development doesn't always happen as fast as
    possible.

    <strong>Putting projects before papers.</strong>
    <!---->
    We work on interesting projects with potential for impact&mdash;not just
    ones that might quickly produce publications.
    <!---->
    When we discover something interesting, publishing is our chance to share
    it with the world.
    <!---->
    We don't work on projects to publish papers&mdash;we work on projects
    because we're curious about what happens when we try something new.

      <a href="/">blue</a> is fortunate to have a single lab large enough
      to house all current group members.
      <!---->
      We work in
      <!---->
      <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/buildings/building?id=davis">Davis Hall</a>
      <!---->
      Room 301B, also know as the PhoneLab.
      <!---->
      All group members&mdash;faculty, administrators, graduate students
      and undergraduates&mdash;work side-by-side in our lab.
      <!---->
      This arrangement is inspired by the organization of groups like the
      Berkeley <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/">AMP Lab</a>, as
      well as the organization of typical startups and technology
      companies.

      <p>
      <!---->
      Working together allows for spontaneous collaboration and problem
      solving.
      <!---->
      Group members are asked to be present in the lab during certain hours
      to facilitate interaction.
      <!---->
      New members find it easy to get started since there are always more
      experienced developers nearby.
      <!---->
      Many group discussions that take place in the lab have benefited from
      being overheard by group members that were not directly engaged in the
      project.
      <!---->
      It also just ends up being a lot of fun!
