== Abstract

This paper outlines the principles of power-agile computing. To begin, we
design a heterogeneous power-proportional device to illustrate the size and
diversity of the state space inherent to these architectures. Next, we
present a scenario demonstrating our device responding to changes in demand.
Using this scenario, we develop a set of challenges inherent to power-agile
operation and discuss approaches to overcoming them.
