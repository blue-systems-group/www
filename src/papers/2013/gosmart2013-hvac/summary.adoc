== Abstract

Optimal control of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is an
important step towards reducing the carbon footprint of buildings and
requires balancing energy reductions and occupant comfort. Conventional
thermostats for temperature set points provide a centralized single point of
user input, often leading to significant thermal discomfort for occupants. We
propose to instead include users in the HVAC control loop through distributed
smart-phone based votes about their thermal comfort for aggregated control of
HVAC. Unlike existing approaches that require in-situ sensors or build
complex comfort models of individual users, we propose a model- and
sensor-free HVAC control algorithm that uses simple user input (hot/cold) and
adapts to changing office occupancy or ambient temperature in real time. We
develop an iterative data fusion algorithm that finds optimal temperature in
offices with multiple users and propose techniques that can aggressively save
energy by drifting indoor temperatures towards the outdoor temperature. Our
evaluation is based on empirical data collected in 12 offices over a 3-week
period and shows that adaptive HVAC control can save up to 60% of energy at a
relatively small increase of 0.3 â—¦C in average occupant discomfort.
