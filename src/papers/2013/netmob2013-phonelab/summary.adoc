== Abstract

This abstract examines the behavior of the participants in PhoneLab, a public
smartphone testbed being developed at the University at Buffalo. Currently
consisting of 191 participants using Nexus S 4G smartphones, PhoneLab aims to
provide a combination of unique features desirable for smartphone
experimentation. This abstract briefly introduces PhoneLab and presents some
of the early results of a usage measurement study conducted with 115
participants.
