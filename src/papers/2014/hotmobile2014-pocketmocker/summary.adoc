== Abstract

We propose a new tool in the battle to allow smartphone users to control
their digital identities: objective-based context mocking. In contrast to
privacy-based approaches that try to limit application access to data,
mocking allows users to manipulate data-driven impressions of their behavior
in well-defined ways, to appear more fit, more social, or more on-time than
they actually are. We describe the design of the PocketMocker system which
uses user-initiated context trace collection and white-hat data analytics
running on the phone to provide control over the mocking process. We also
present data from a survey indicating that many users would feel comfortable
using our system.
