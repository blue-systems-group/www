== Abstract

As mobile devices become increasingly complex power management requires
communication across multiple layers of the system. Future systems with
complex interactions will require interfaces that allow
performance-and-energy information to be communicated between hardware and
the operating system. We present a plan for interfaces between the
application, OS, and hardware. We introduce the concept of inefficiency which
can be used to encapsulate the priorities between tasks.
