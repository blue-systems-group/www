== Abstract

Smartphone consumers, app developers, and even mobile systems researchers
operate under the assumption that performance differences between identical
smartphones should be small.
//
Consumers pick a model to purchase and donâ€™t consider that the specific
device they leave the store with may vary quite dramatically from the
identical models it sat next to on the shelf.
//
App rating systems typically collect the model from reviewers, but not more
detailed information--again, assuming that all instances of a particular
model perform similarly.
//
Even mobile systems researchers will conduct studies using small numbers of
devices that fail to account or control for inherent differences between
identical phones.

Unfortunately seemingly-identical smartphones can in fact have very different
performance characteristics.
//
Note that we are not referring to differences in battery or Flash performance
caused over time by wear.
//
Inherent differences would separate two brand-new phones still in the
original packaging. Our experiments show up to 20% performance and energy
consumption differences between otherwise identical devices.
//
These differences result from process variation in the manufacture of
smartphone CPUs, which causes some CPUs to perform much more poorly than
others.
//
This paper explains the causes of this variation, measures its impacts, and
discusses implications for smartphone researchers, software developers, and
consumers.
