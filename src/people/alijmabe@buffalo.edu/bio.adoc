I'm a first year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science and Engineering
Department of the State University of New York at Buffalo. My research
interests are in operating systems, distributed systems, and mobile systems.

I received my B.S. degree in computer science from Kuwait University in 2005.
After graduation, I decided to work for few years before pursuing my graduate
studies. In 2011, I moved to New York City to pursue my graduate studies in
the City College of New York ([.spelling_exception]#CUNY#). I received my
M.S. degree in computer science from the City College in 2013 and moved back
to Kuwait. After working again for one year in Kuwait, I received an
admission offer from University at Buffalo into Ph.D. computer science and
engineering program for fall 2014 semester and moved to Buffalo since then.

During my graduate studies at the City College, I was a member of research
group that worked mainly in the fields of data structures, algorithms, and
computational geometry. C is my primary programming language that I have used
almost for all my undergraduate and graduate projects. By the time I got
master's degree, my research interest has shifted to operating systems. Upon
receiving my PhD admission offer and considering my research options at UB, I
have decided to work with Prof. Geoffrey Challen in the systems field. I
joined Blue research group during my first semester at UB and Iâ€™m so excited
about the projects we are working on.
