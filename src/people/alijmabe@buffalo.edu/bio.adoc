I'm a second year Ph.D. student at the http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/[Computer Science and Engineering Department] of http://www.buffalo.edu/[University at Buffalo]. My research interests are in mobile systems, operating systems, and distributed systems.

I received my B.S. degree in computer science from http://www.kuniv.edu/[Kuwait University] in 2005. After graduation, I decided to work for few years before pursuing my graduate studies. In 2011, I moved to New York City to pursue my graduate studies in the http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/[City College of New York (CUNY)]. I received my M.S. degree in computer science from CCNY in 2013 and moved back to Kuwait. After working again for one year in Kuwait, I received an admission offer from UB into Ph.D. computer science and engineering program for fall 2014 semester and moved to Buffalo since then.

During my graduate studies at CCNY, I was a member of research group that worked mainly in the fields of data structures, algorithms, and computational geometry. By the time I got master's degree, my research interest has shifted to systems field. Upon receiving my PhD admission offer and considering my research options at UB, I have decided to work with Prof. link:/people/gwa/[Geoffrey Challen] in the systems field. I joined link:/[blue Systems Research Group] during my first semester at UB and contributed to the link:/projects/maybe/[maybe] uncertainty-based adaptation project during spring 2015 semester. Currently, I'm working on recognizing personal device usage patterns project.
