I am  a 5th year Ph.D. student. My research interests lie broadly in
mobile computing and wireless networking.

I started my PhD. in 2010 after completing my MS in Computer Science here at
the University at Buffalo. I'm co-advised by Prof. Chunming Qiao and Prof.
Geoffrey Challen. I am planning to defend my dissertation in Spring 2015 and
I'm currently searching for a suitable position after my graduation.
