I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at University at Buffalo. My current research work is in link:/projects/jouler[Flexible
Smartphone Energy Management] where we explore flexible framework and  innovative policies to smartly manage
energy in smartphones. I am interested in all aspects of mobile computing and also in systems security.


To be truthful, it was not a quirk of fate that I find myself interested in Computer Science.
Since school days, as early as 4th-5th grade, Computer Science has always been one of my favorite
subjects. So after school it was not hard to decide that I want to pursue
higher studies in Computer Science. But that's the easy part. During my undergrad years in West Bengal
University of Technology (in India), I was completely sure that I am only interested in Network and Information
Security and accordingly worked on few related projects. I finished my B.Tech in 2009. It was only after
coming to University at Buffalo on Fall 2010
that I was exposed to other interesting research fields in computer science. It was like being left unsupervised in a
candy store for an year or so. Soon I zeroed my interest on mobile computing, to be specific on smartphones.
After finishing my Masters in Science, I joined the blue group under the mentorship of Geoffrey Challen
to continue my doctoral studies in Spring 2012.

Other than research, I have  a few more interests that I try to indulge in. I
absolutely love traveling, dancing and eating. The top 3 things in my bucket
list named "Before 2018 December" are: backpacking for 2 months across South
America, private pilot license, and certified sky diver.
