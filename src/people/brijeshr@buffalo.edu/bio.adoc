I am a second-year undergraduate majoring in computer science here at the
University at Buffalo. I am working with link:/[blue] through the
link:/proposals/2013-reu-phonelab/[PhoneLab REU]. I am passionate about
learning something related to computers *every day*, and being a sophomore
makes it more interesting as I have so much to learn. After joining PhoneLab
it seems I'm getting more inclined towards mobile systems!

I became curious about computers when I first joined my high school's
robotics team--The [.spelling_exception]#GalaxyRoboTechs#! We used to
participate in several competitions which were organized by
http://www.usfirst.org/[FIRST] and
[.spelling_exception]#http://www.wroboto.org/[WRO]#. It
gave me an amazing opportunity to explore various fields such as robotics,
research and designing. We represented India and achieved prestigious awards
at various international robotic events in USA, Germany and Malaysia. These
experiences helped me figure out what I love--programming! After I graduated
from my high school, I mentored various teams which represented India in
various robotic competitions, which helped me develop my leadership skills.

I joined the University at Buffalo in August 2013, and figured out there's so
many things I can do while I'm here. I joined UB's ACM chapter & Robotics
Club, and worked on interesting stuff! I have also worked with Dr. Varun
Chandola on his research project
[.spelling_exception]#http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~chandola/iglobe/iglobe.html[iGlobe]#. In
February 2015, I joined PhoneLab where I'm exploring various components of
academic research and getting my hands-on mobile systems alongside
http://blue.cse.buffalo.edu/people/gwa/[Geoffrey Challen] and
http://blue.cse.buffalo.edu/people/nvdirien/[Nick DiRienzo]. 

I look forward to give my best to PhoneLab!
