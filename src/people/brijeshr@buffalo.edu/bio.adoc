//
I am a fourth-year computer science undergraduate working in link:/[blue]
through the
//
link:/proposals/2013-reu-phonelab/[PhoneLab REU].
//
My interests are inclined towards operating systems and web.
//
I am also a Teaching Assistant for
//
https://www.internet-class.org[How Internet Works]
//
and
//
http://catalog.buffalo.edu/courses/?abbr=CSE&num=250[Data Structures in C++].

I became curious about computers when I first joined my high school's
robotics team--The [.spelling_exception]#GalaxyRoboTechs#! We used to
participate in several competitions which were organized by
http://www.usfirst.org/[FIRST] and
[.spelling_exception]#http://www.wroboto.org/[WRO]#. It
gave me an amazing opportunity to explore various fields such as robotics,
research and designing. We represented India and achieved prestigious awards
at various international robotic events in USA, Germany and Malaysia. These
experiences helped me figure out that I wanted to pursue Computer Science that point forward. After I graduated
from my high school, I mentored various teams which represented India in
various robotic competitions, which helped me develop my leadership skills.

I joined The University at Buffalo (UB) in 2013, and started working with
//
https://phone-lab.org[PhoneLab] on systems research in my sophomore year.
//
In Summer 2016, I interned with http://www.viacom.com[Viacom] where I worked
on adding live-streaming support to http://www.mtv.com[MTV's] existing
Apple-TV app.
//
I will be graduating from UB in Spring 2017, therefore I'm actively looking
for full-time opportunities in the area of systems and web.
