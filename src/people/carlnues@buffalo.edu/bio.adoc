I recently completed my masters and a first year student.  I am interested broadly in systems research.

In PhoneLab, I am studying how file access on mobile platforms compares to that of more traditional platforms.
Looking ahead, I am interested in researching the performance and optimization of system platforms.  I am a
returning student with a formal math background.  Much has changed since the days of Pascal.
