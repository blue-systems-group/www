== How to Flip a Large Class

[.snippet.lead]
//
--
//
This semester I've been rolling out a link:/courses/ub-199-fall-2016/[new
course on the internet] in a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom[flipped classroom] format.
//
Despite nominally being a seminar, the course enrolls 440 students and meets
for activities in two large groups, one with 99 students and another with
341.
//
The course has been a lot of fun, and I've learned a lot along the way.
//
We've had to overcome many challenges--some of which I anticipated, and some
of which caught me by surprise footnote:[Although you could argue--and I would
agree--that all of them should have been easy to anticipate.].

Note that this post focuses on the infrastructure and management challenges
of flipping a large course.
//
We're also doing something quite interesting with the video delivery, but
I'll return to that in a later post.

=== What Is A/Our Flipped Classroom?

To begin, just brief review for the uninitiated.
//
In a flipped classroom you flip the lecturing out of class and flip the
homework or course activities in to class.
//
The goal, as far as I see it, is to align the things that benefit from
supervision (homework) with the hours that you can supervise students (class
meetings).
//
As a technologist, I also consider this approach a better match with what we
can do with technology (monitoring online video viewing) and the things that
we can't do with technology (provide interactive help with homework).
//
(I have also recorded a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i_BgT26iYM[short
explanation of the flipped classroom model] using Legos borrowed from my
friend Marlon.)

In _our_ flipped classroom, students watch around 20 5-minute videos covering
various internet topics each week.
//
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk97mPCd8nvbxGGfkYkBXrSEvpTc1xTF8[Here's
the entire list], currently at 250 videos over 13 weeks.
//
On Monday and Wednesday students attend a 50-minute meeting where they
complete an activity in pairs or groups of four.
//
We refer to these as _activity sections_ to distinguish them from lectures.
//
Course recitations are taught on Thursdays and Fridays and are taught by
faculty--as required by the
https://www.buffalo.edu/ubcurriculum/seminar.html[UB Seminar Program].
//
Grading is primarily based on participation.
//
Students receive credit for watching the short videos before the deadline and
attending and participating in the activity sections.
//
They are also required to record several new video explanations for course
concepts which are graded by the course staff.

Why this class is called a seminar is a somewhat long story.
//
Here's the short version.
//
UB decided that all freshman should have a seminar taught by a faculty member
to groups of 28 students.
//
[.pullquote]#Unfortunately, the only departments with enough faculty to teach
these new required seminars are ones with too many faculty and too few
students.#
//
In computer science, we have too many students and too few faculty.

Initially we had two options.
//
One was to find faculty volunteers to teach 16 small seminars.
//
I tried that.
//
It didn't work.
//
The second option was let our students take a seminar on subjects like "The
Writing of Food Politics" footnote:[Which sounds interesting, or at least "I
can't figure out what it is about by the title" interesting.].
//
Not that I have any problem with computer scientists having a broad-based
liberal arts education, but that seemed like a missed opportunity.

Luckily for us, several other departments convinced the seminar program to
grandfather in their existing larger courses.
//
After some negotiations, we received permission to hold 100-student lectures
as long as they were accompanied by a seminar-size recitation.
//
And that created an opportunity to rethink the seminar experience as a huge
flipped classroom.

=== Step 1: Get a Room

link:/people/gjbunyea[Greg] and I spent the months and weeks before the class
launched anticipating and addressing lots of potential problems.
//
Some of them are described in more detail below.
//
But it wasn't until a few days before classes started that we discovered one
of the biggest challenges to teaching a huge flipped class.
//
*All of the classrooms that we had been assigned were completely unsuited to
group activities.*

The course was originally planned as three 100-student sections taught at the
same time in neighboring classrooms.
//
But when we visited those classrooms, we found seats bolted to tables,
stadium seating, and narrow aisles.
//
[.pullquote]#Most current university classrooms are purpose-built for
lecturing.#
//
I guess that's why they call them lecture halls...

Could we have used these classrooms?
//
Sure.
//
We could have limited the activity group size to two so that students could
work side-by-side, the only configuration the rooms allowed.
//
Our teaching assistants could have hiked up and down the steep stairways and
squeezed through narrow aisles to reach groups that needed help.
//
But that sounded terrible.
//
So we went to look for other solutions.

And then--a miracle.
//
We found Bert's.
//
Bert's is an on-campus cafeteria.
//
I've noticed it for years, mainly because it has that lovely cafeteria smell
that makes it impossible to miss as you walk by.
//
Bert's seats 500 students in two equal-sized areas, mostly in groups of four.
//
And at our seminar meeting times--9AM and 4PM--it is largely empty.
//
Technically, half of the cafeteria is closed at 4PM, which was good because
we had 340 students we wanted to bring down at that time.

Getting permission to use Bert's was so easy it almost made me pinch myself:

[quote]
____
Me: Can I bring 340 students down here at 4PM?

Bert's Manager: Sure.

Me: Really?

Bert's Manager: Sure.

Me: Do you really work at UB?

Bert's Manager: Sure.
____

A few days later the same extremely agreeable manager allowed us to use part
of Bert's at 9AM, when the cafeteria is open and serving breakfast.
//
We only have 99 students at that time, which doesn't interfere with
early-morning diners.
//
And that was that.

To guide students to where their group is located, we created an online
https://www.internet-class.org/img/berts.png[seating chart].
//
Students are assigned to new tables each week via email.
//
When they arrive in class, they use this to locate their table or group.
//
The first few times we tried this, chaos ensued for around 10 minutes.
//
But after a few iterations, students got the hang of it.
//
At this point, they find their groups quickly and easily and get to work.

// Lecturing is literally _physically embedded_ into today's campuses, in a way
// that is extremely difficult to change.
