This is my fourth year as an undergraduate in computer engineering at the
University at Buffalo. My time here has been full of interesting events as
well as unexpected opportunities. Before I was in the PhoneLab I was and
still am involved in the custom ROM and Android modification community over
at xda and was building ROMs as a hobby. I am now one of the Systems
Administrators and platform developers for the PhoneLab. I am also working on
logging all API calls in the platform.

I've been working with computers ever since my middle school years when I was
finding ways to run my own programs on school computers by running them on
flash drives. After I was introduced to Linux in my high school I have been
slowly integrating myself into the Linux environment and growing in the open
source community. I am currently a programming mentor for my local FIRST
robotics team 1507. I enjoy being able to show the kids in my high school all
of the things they can do with the knowledge and skills they acquire through
the robotics program. I am also an avid tinkerer. I am always working on some
idea I have come up with in my spare time when I should probably be working
on more important things. This lab has allowed me to really expand upon my
abilities though. Seeing what they do in the lab with these devices is
amazing and has only led me further towards an interest in mobile hardware
applications. I don't know what it's going to be like for me here in six
months, but I can't wait to find out.
