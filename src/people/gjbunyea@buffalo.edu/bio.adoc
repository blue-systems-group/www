I'm a Junior at http://www.buffalo.edu/[UB] studying Computer Science and Art. I aim to become a high school computer science teacher.

In Summer 2016 I was given the opportunity to develop link:/projects/internetclass/[CSE 199: How the Internet Works] with Geoff Challen and 25 other UTAs. The class was a great success and will stay with me as one of my most significant experiences at UB. The course provided me with a greater affirmation that education is the place for me.

Currently I'm working on processing CSE 199 data for the future of http://internet-class.org[internet-class.org] with https://www.linkedin.com/in/heeba/[Heeba Kariapper]. We hope to publish a paper and submit to http://sigcse.org/sigcse/[SIGCSE] about our experience with CSE 199 and the lessons learned. I take any opportunity to contribute to computer science education at UB and in the broader community.

Outside of academia, I'm learning to cook and am training for a half-marathon I'll run with my 3 siblings next August!
