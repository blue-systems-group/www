I am a fourth year Ph.D. student. My research work focuses on efficient
computation. I work on link:/projects/thermaplan[ThermaPlan] and
link:/projects/poweragility[Power Agile Operating Systems]. My research
interests lie in operating systems, networking and mobile systems.

I love to code and so while I'm not playing computer games, I spend time on
other coding projects. In the past,
http://odin.cse.buffalo.edu/people/oliver_kennedy.html[Oliver] and I have
worked on a http://www.github.com/okennedy/worldtree.git[constrained world
generator] for games. I'm also trying to get my quadcopter to fly and am
working on a http://wavelength.fm[Wavelength] clone so people can watch videos
together.

My ongoing hobbies include coming up with ways to improve the classroom
experience by synchronizing slides between the teacher and the students while
also incorporating features so students can ask questions on the slide and have
them answered by the teaching staff. I'm also trying to build a
http://github.com/gurupras/keymaker.git[system] that will make key distribution
among all my machines and Github easier.

Occasionally, I participate in hackathons where I use the time to build things
that I would like to use.  In the past, me and link:/people/ans25[Anand] have
won an award for _hack with most economic impact_ at the UB Hackathon (2014)
for our hack on cloud storage.  link:/people/shaseley[Scott Haseley],
http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~kbhandar[Kushal Bhandari] and I won second place
in the Google Developers Group(GDG) Hackathon conducted in 2015 for
https://github.com/gurupras/gdg-hackathon[AudioShare], a way to broadcast and
share audio across Android devices.

My tryst with computers began when my father took a huge loan to purchase a PC
spec'd at 166 MHz having 32 MB RAM and a 1 GB HDD running Windows 95. Games
were soon to follow with Microsoft's Pinball and Midway's Mortal Kombat 3. Me
and my dad had this cat and mouse game we would play wherein he would find new
ways to prevent me from playing--BIOS lock, hidden folders, etc and I would be
forced to bypass these measures. I spent a lot of time working on
http://openkore.com[OpenKore] -- a bot for Ragnarok Online, a popular MMORPG.
Most of my work was on trying to ensure that the bot remained undetected while
still going out and playing on my behalf. Since a lot of this was tailor made
(hard-coded) for my purposes, I never made any push to the OpenKore source.

I did my undergrad in Computer Science at SRM University
and joined the Masters program at the University at Buffalo in 2011. I started
working with Geoffrey Challen in the fall of 2012 and was quickly drawn to
research. This was what I had always wanted to do - build complex systems of my
own. I joined the Ph.D. program in 2013.
