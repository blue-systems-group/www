I'm a first year PhD student at Blue. I joined UB during Fall 2013
and decided to extend my Masters to the PhD program. My research interests
include mobile systems, wireless networking and databases.

I graduated BE with distinction from Bangalore University, India. Soon after
graduation, I moved to Buffalo to pursue a Masters degree. With the right set
of people around me, I was motivated to pursue a PhD program. 

I'm presently associated with Blue researching on problems in mobile
environments. I interned as a developer as well as a researcher both at
start-ups and corporates. In my spare time I troll
www.stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow], play piano and learn Spanish.
