I am  a second year Ph.D. student. My research interests lie broadly in
wireless networks and mobile systems. I'm particularly interested in exploring
the potential and opportunities brought by the smartphones in (almost) everyone's
pocket!

I got my B.S. degree in Computer Science from University of Science and
Technology of China in 2011. After that, I spent one and a half year at Hone
Kong University, before I finally decided to quit and join the blue group here
at Buffalo in 2013.
