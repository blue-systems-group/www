I'm a second year computer science undergraduate at the University at
Buffalo.  I've been working with link:/[blue] since June, 2015 on the
link:/projects/jouler/[Jouler] project.  When I started CSE 115 in the fall
semester of my freshman year, I absolutely fell in love with programming and
wanted to learn as much as I possibly could.  Since then I have taught myself
how to make Android and iOS applications as well as websites, scripts, games
and databases.  I am expanding my knowledge every day and I love it.

I am very determined in making use of all of the opportunities the University
at Buffalo has to offer during my short time here as an undergraduate.  So,
when I first heard about the ACM chapter at UB, I joined straight away.  I
joined with the desire to meet other people that were as motivated to learn
as me, and I did just that.  Through my involvement in ACM I got involved in
maintaining and making changes to the ACM http://www.ubacm.org/[website].
During one of our ACM meetings in the Spring, long-time member and Senior
link:/people/nvdirien/[Nick DiRienzo] made a pitch about Blue and
said that they were accepting undergraduate researchers.  I immediately
retrieved his contact information and he put me in touch with
link:/people/gwa/[Geoffrey Challen] with whom I set a
meeting, and it was scheduled for me to start working at the beginning of the
summer!

Currently, link:/people/anudipa/[Anudipa Maiti] and I are
working on link:/projects/jouler/[Jouler].  In our research, we are
attempting to find the best way to manage energy on Android devices.  Through
user feedback, we have created several policies for the user to select
depending on how they want their energy managed.  We also, through hacking
the https://source.android.com/[Android Open Source Project], have created
new ways to conserve energy that you couldn’t do on a factory Android device.
This research is perfect for me because with my degree I’d like to get into
working in an energy-related field or something to do mobile devices.
