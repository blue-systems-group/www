I'm a junior in University at Buffalo, pursuing computer science degree. I started my college career as an aerospace engineering major, as I was passionate about learning how aircraft work. I took some introductory computer science classes and found that I enjoyed computer science and programming. Thus began my exciting journey in computer science! I have broad range of interests and I am exploring what I like by trying my hands on various projects/learning experiences. 

I have been working in link:https://blue.cse.buffalo.edu/[blue Systems Research Group] and link:http://odin.cse.buffalo.edu/[ODIn Lab] since summer 2016 on link:http://odin.cse.buffalo.edu/research/pocketdata/[PocketData] project. My work mainly involves analyzing query patterns generated by smart phone apps. I find it both interesting and challenging. I hope to give it my best and learn as much as I can out of this experience.

Outside computer science, I am a voracious reader. I also enjoy traveling and outdoor activities.
