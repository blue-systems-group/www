I work as the link:/projects/phonelab/[PhoneLab] administrator. I help
participants with any issues they may have with given smartphones. I interact
with Sprint to handle the logistics of our account and assist with PhoneLab
development. 

I got B.S. degree in Computer Engineering from California State University,
Fresno. I worked for IBM as an engineer and technical sales professional for
many years before obtaining my M.S. degree in Computer Science from the
University at Buffalo Working for PhoneLab is a great opportunity for me as I
enjoy technology and people.
