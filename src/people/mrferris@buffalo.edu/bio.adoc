I am a third year computer engineering student from Hamburg, NY. As a member
of link:/[blue], I am exploring the practical implications of replacing
persistent storage with cloud storage in smartphones, from file-system
integration with the network to application-level programming practices. 

My passion for distributed systems engineering extends beyond smartphones. I
have led the design and implementation of the software system for the UB
[.spelling_exception]#Nanosatellite# Program's flagship spacecraft that is
due to be launched to low earth orbit by both NASA and the US Air Force in
2017. This 2-node distributed spacecraft network will demonstrate the ability
for such a network to augment the United State's ability to monitor space
objects. 

The parallels between distributed systems made up of smartphones and those
made up of spacecraft are very interesting to me. In the future I would like
to apply the distributed systems knowledge and practices of the smartphone
industry to the spacecraft industry.

I worked as a software engineering intern at NASA throughout the summers of
2013 and 2014, and I plan to graduate with a BS in Computer Engineering in
the spring of 2016. After graduation I have two hopes: to work somewhere
where I can build cool things and to live somewhere where the weather doesn't
hurt.
