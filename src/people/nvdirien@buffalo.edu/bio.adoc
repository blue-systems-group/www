I am a fourth-year computer science undergraduate working in blue through the
PhoneLab REU. My interests are primarily in mobile systems and distributed
systems, and I generally love software engineering. I am also a Teaching
Assistant for Distributed Systems and Intro to Computer Science.

I joined https://github.com/mort11[MORT], my high school's
https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc[FIRST Robotics Competition]
team, which exposed me to Java and robotics. During my senior year, I led the
programming team for MORT where I taught students Java and developed our
[.spelling_exception]#tele-operational# and autonomous processes.

I joined the University at Buffalo in 2011, and instantly started working in
Dr. Jason Corso's group, which introduced me to academic research and helped
hone my programming skills. From August 2012 to May 2014, I was president of

nights, and link:http://ubhacking.com[UB Hacking], our university's annual
hackathon. In November 2013, I joined PhoneLab, where I jumped right into
mobile systems research working alongside Geoffrey Challen.

Since my first-year, I have interned with Google (in 2012 and 2013) and

will be joining Optimizely as a Software Engineer, where I will be helping
companies turn data into action.
