I'm a first year Ph.D. student at the http://www.buffalo.edu[University at
Buffalo], where I research mobile systems and operating systems.  
Currently, I'm working on measuring and quantifying quality of experience
on mobile systems.

Before formally joing the link:/[blue Systems Research Group] this year, 
I worked with the group while earning my Masters in the spring of 2014.
During that time, I worked on `link:/projects/poweragility[Power Agile Operating Systems] 
and link:/projects/sustainability[SmartPhone Sustainability].  Prior to that, I earned my
B.S in mathematics from UB in 2004.

When I'm not hacking in the lab, I enjoy traveling, brewing (hopefully) delicious craft
beer, and listening to and playing music.
