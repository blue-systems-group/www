I'm a second year Ph.D. student at the http://www.buffalo.edu[University at
Buffalo], where I research mobile systems and operating systems. Currently, I
work on quantifying and improving smartphone link:/projects/qoe[quality of
experience (QoE)].

Before formally joining the link:/[blue Systems Research Group] in the fall
of 2015, I worked with the group while earning my Masters degree in the spring
of 2014.  During that time, I worked on link:/projects/poweragility[Power Agile
Operating Systems] and link:/projects/sustainability[SmartPhone
Sustainability].  Prior
to that, I earned my B.S. degree in mathematics from UB in 2004.

When I'm not hacking in the lab, I enjoy traveling, cooking, brewing delicious
craft beer, and listening to and playing music.
