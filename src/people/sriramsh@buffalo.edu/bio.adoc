I'm a second year Masters student. My primary research interest is mobile
systems and I enjoy developing apps.

I have an undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication from
[.spelling_exception]#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Jayachamarajendra_College_of_Engineering[SJCE].#
I mostly ignored the electronics part (except during the exams) and
concentrated on the remaining subjects which mainly dealt with signal
processing, information theory and beginner AI courses. After graduating, I
joined Motorola Inc where I worked as an Android app developer. I later
joined the Push-to-Talk over Cellular team whose VoIP solution is used by
government agencies in US.

At UB, I initially intended to specialize in AI but ended up liking systems
more. My primary areas of interest are mobile systems especially Android and machine learning. When I'm on campus I can be usually found in PhoneLab, which has become
my second home or hanging out at La Rosa Pizzeria in The Commons.

In my free time I explore and photograph little-known places in the city,
especially on sunny days. I love traveling and recently I've been teaching
myself how to create 3D models and renders. I also blog occasionally at
