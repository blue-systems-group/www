I am a Junior majoring in Computer Science at UB. My tryst with programming
started less than a year ago. My learning curve has been steep but extremely
rewarding. Nick Back once stated, "...if you aren't, at any given time,
scandalized by code you wrote five or three years ago, you're not learning
anywhere near enough". Thankfully though, I experience this almost every
alternate day.

I had the opportunity of working with mobile programming and mobile systems
in the summer of 2016 when I started working in the PhoneLab as a
undergraduate developer. In the Fall 2015 I worked as a junior web developer
for the Behavorial Medicine Lab, University at Buffalo wherein I handled the
front-end of the Revoluion Database System. I thoroughly enjoy the experience
of solving problems using a computer which inspires me to not just be a
code-monkey but a computer scientist.
