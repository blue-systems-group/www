I'm a second year Ph.D. student.
My research interests include smartphone energy management and wearable devices.

We have modified Android Open Source Project to add energy management policy
framework. We call it link:/projects/jouler/[Jouler]. It provides APIs for
developers to write their own energy management policy. Related experiments
show that Jouler works well under both controlled experiments and when
deployed on the link:/projects/phonelab/[PhoneLab] smartphone platform
testbed.

I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from North China
Institute of Science and Technology in 2008. After that, I got my master
degree in Software Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology in 2011.
As a graduate student, I studied with [.spelling_exception]#Chunxia Zhang#.
She led us for a project named Theory and Method to Ontology Learning Field
about Chinese Text, funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China.

I spent one year for some temporary works in China and finally decided to pursue
a Ph.D. degree. I got offer and joined the University at Buffalo in 2013. I have
really enjoyed the experience of studying at UB and blue, and I have learned a lot.
