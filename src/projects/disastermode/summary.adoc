When disaster strikes, the smartphone in your pocket could be a powerful
ally, helping you locate resources, navigate to safety, assist others, and
contact loved ones, all while collecting sensor data to help emergency
responders understand the unfolding situation on the ground. But today's
smartphones are prepared to do only one thing well during a disaster: run out
of battery. We investigated Android support for a _disaster mode_ allowing
smartphones to prepare for and operate effectively during disasters.

Natural disasters should be an ideal environment for today's ubiquitous
smartphones, allowing them to put their power, connectivity, and sensing
capabilities to a truly critical purpose: helping their user survive and
escape, especially while traveling in an unknown rapidly changing location.
Unfortunately, disaster environments challenge smartphones' core assumptions,
requiring radical adaptation that today's phones cannot perform.  During
typical operation, smartphones assume that energy is plentiful--making
sub-day device lifetime acceptable--and that high-speed mobile data and Wifi
networks are almost always available. During a disaster, these assumptions
fail: power is scarce, the phone may need to last for days, and networks are
down or overloaded. To compound the problem, smartphones face these
challenges at the moment when they are needed most, since users are likely to
be navigating unfamiliar routes to detour around hazardous areas, attempting
to find or reassure loved ones, communicating with rescuers, and gathering
data to reassess rapidly-changing conditions.

We explored new techniques enabling smartphone _disaster mode_, a setting
similar to the familiar airplane mode. When a disaster is imminent, disaster
mode helps users get ready, by preparing their phone and gathering data to
identify vulnerable communities and individuals. When disaster strikes,
disaster mode enables aggressive energy management, novel user interfaces,
and new communication patterns, all working together to retain essential
functionality while maximizing battery life. The YouTube playlist above

discussing various components of the project.

As the culmination of the project our team participated in the White
House-sponsored http://smartamerica.org/[SmartAmerica Challenge] and
presented our results at the SmartAmerica Expo held in Washington, DC, in
June 2014.
