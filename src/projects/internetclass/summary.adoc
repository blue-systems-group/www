//
The Internet is transforming every aspect of our lives, including how we
communicate, navigate, organize, work, play, and love.
//
And it will also transform how we learn and teach.
//
However, current online education
platforms suffer design flaws that limit their effectiveness.
//
Specifically, online courses ignore many of the lessons of the Internet's
spectacular success.
//
In Fall 2016, link:/[blue] will teach a new course on the internet designed
to reflect some of the core features of today's internet.
//
We plan to realize a new approach to online learning called _learning webs_.

Learning webs incorporate the following design principles missing from many
current online courses:

* *Avoid single points of failure.*
// 
Most online courses are full of single points of failure.
//
Small groups of instructors represent one single point of failure.
//
If a student fails to connect with the instructor that is teaching the
course, the whole course is ineffective.
//
Individual lessons are another single point of failure.
//
If a student fails to grasp a concept after one explanation, there are
usually few if any alternatives available--and usually those are provided by
the same instructor.
//
_Learning webs engage large groups of instructors and experts that create a
course together and avoid single points of failure._

* *Modularity creates collaboration.*
//
Today's online courses are monolithic entities.
//
Built from large chunks of content and frequently trapped within
closed-source systems, existing online courses are hard to modify or extend.
//
This prevents the formation of instructional communities and leads to a great
deal of duplicated effort.
//
_Learning webs are designed to be modular--both in content and in
structure--to encourage many different instructors to build similar courses
using shared materials._

* *Leverage the crowd.*
//
Because today's online courses are designed by small groups and difficult to
extend, the miss opportunities to leverage the crowd: crowds of instructors,
crowds of experts, or crowds of students.
//
_Learning webs democratize the process of creating courses and are
specifically designed to leverage crowds of students, teachers, and
experts._

* *Innovate at the edge.*
//
Existing online learning platforms spend a lot of time building complex
website that are supposed to be easy for non-technologists to use.
//
But the resulting products are frequently [.spelling_exception]#dumbed-down#
to the point that they frustrate expert users and miss opportunities to
engage those with website development skills or new ideas that could improve
online content delivery.
//
_Learning webs are intended to enable innovation at the edge through a
simplified online content delivery platform that is only intended to be easy
for technologists to use._
//
But by appealing to instructors at the edge we hope to innovate much more
rapidly, with the tradeoff of only providing a small number of
technology-related courses.
