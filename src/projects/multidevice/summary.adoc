//
Many people today interact with multiple personal computing devices: one or
more desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and wearables.
//
Each of these devices offers different capabilities and form factors.
//
We are studying how users transition between multiple devices and choose
devices to perform specific tasks.
//
We have found that a wearable device such as a smartwatch, positioned on the
user's dominant hand, can accurately identify various input devices and
modalities associated with different kinds of personal devices: keyboards v.
touchscreens, mice v. trackpads, etc.
//
In most cases identifying several input features of a particular device is
sufficient to distinguish it from the users' other personal devices.

We are studying transitions between personal devices for several reasons.
//
First, we suspect that understanding these transitions will help improve the
performance and design of the many cloud services that seek to unify the
computing experience across multiple devices.
//
File sharing services like Dropbox, for example, may aggressively synchronize
state between multiple devices even if they are not used concurrently by the
user.
//
In this case, bandwidth and energy savings may result from delaying the
updates until it is likely that the user will begin to use the device that
updates are being sent to.

Second, we are interested in determining how users choose the _right_ device
for various computing tasks.
//
Anecdotal evidence indicates that choices between devices are complicated and
interesting.
//
For example, multiple users have reported to us that they like to check email
on their smartphone even if other devices are available.
//
Because it is more difficult to write length replies on a touchscreen
keyboard, this helps them limit unnecessary responses to emails that are not
time sensitive.
//
Eventually we would like to add app usage information to our device tracking
dataset to help identify these kinds of behaviors.

Finally, we anticipate ever closer integration between multiple personal
devices in the future, eventually forming what we refer to as a
link:/courses/ub_720_fall_2014/[personal cloud computer].
//
The goal of these systems will be to enable _seamless transfer of attention_
where users can transition tasks from one device to another without any of
the friction that accompanies those transitions today.
//
For example, a user should be able to seamlessly take a photo on their
smartphone, edit it on their laptop, and then use it to start a email back on
their smartphone.
//
We expect that tighter integration between multiple personal devices will
require new operating system services and techniques.
