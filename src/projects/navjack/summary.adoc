Ubiquitous personal vehicles are the ideal platform for deploying city-scale
sensor networks, providing available power, good spatial coverage, and
predictable quasi-stationary mobility patterns. The challenge is figuring out
how to get inside the cars operated by thousands of people in an urban area.
We are exploring a novel way of doing so by *hijacking personal
navigation devices based on discarded smartphones* to create a large-scale
sensing platform which we call Navjack.

When the vehicle is on, the Navjack unit guides the user to their destination
and offers vehicle monitoring capabilities. While the vehicle is off--which
is most of the time--the Navjack unit acts as a stationary sensing platform
transmitting data from its own sensors and other sensors deployed on the
vehicle. Once deployed, we will evaluate the Navjack approach by comparing
its coverage and cost with other alternatives and address the problem of
ensuring good spatial coverage by and optimizing sensor queries over
quasi-stationary Navjack sensor networks.
