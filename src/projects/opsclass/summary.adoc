//
Operating systems are the masterworks of computer systems--stable, mature,
well-designed systems that have evolved for decades to respond to user needs
and hardware capabilities.
//
http://www.ops-class.org[ops-class.org] is an online framework based on the
Harvard's http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~dholland/os161/[OS/161 instruction
operating system] designed to allow students anywhere to learn to design and
program operating systems.

Currently http://www.ops-class.org[ops-class.org] is used by
link:/people/gwa/[Geoffrey Challen] and the link:/[blue Systems Research
Group] at the University at Buffalo (UB) to link:/courses/[teach] "CSE
421/521: Introduction to Operating Systems."
//
The `ops-class` framework has successfully provided UB students with the
ability to complete _the same assignments offered to Harvard students_
despite significantly-fewer human instructional resources.
//
By automating and standardizing online grading,
http://www.ops-class.org[ops-class.org] allows teaching assistants to reduce
the time they spend grading and increase the time they spend helping students
complete the assignments.

In 2016, link:/people/shaseley[Scott Haseley] and link:/people/ychen78[Yihong
Chen] significantly improve the existing automated grading infrastructure
through the addition of a new declarative distributed testing tool called
link:https://test161.ops-class.org[`test161`].
//
`test161` now allows students anywhere to complete and evaluate the
automatically-graded portions of the OS/161 assignments for free on their own
machines.
//
`test161` secures the remote testing process by embedding secrets into the
testing suite at compile time.
//
This allows us to distribute almost all tests to students--avoiding the
"security via obscurity" approach taken by many classes that use automated
grading--while preventing students from reverse engineering graded
evaluations.
//
`test161` also maintains leader boards and shows the progress of online
grading interactively through a web interface built using
https://www.meteor.com[Meteor] and https://facebook.github.io/react/[React].
