Operating systems are the masterworks of computer systems--stable, mature,
well-designed systems that have evolved for decades to respond to user needs
and hardware capabilities. http://www.ops-class.org[ops-class.org] is an
online framework based on the Harvard's
http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~dholland/os161/[OS/161 instruction operating
system] designed to allow students anywhere to learn to design and program
operating systems.

Currently http://www.ops-class.org[ops-class.org] is used by
link:/people/gwa/[Geoffrey Challen] at the University at Buffalo to teach
"CSE 421/521: Introduction to Operating Systems." Over the three years that
the framework has been under development, it has succeeded in providing UB
students with the ability to complete _the same assignments offered to
Harvard students_ despite significantly-fewer human instructional resources.
By automating and standardizing online grading,
http://www.ops-class.org[ops-class.org] allows teaching assistants to reduce
the time they spend grading and increase the time they spend helping students
complete the assignments.

Once the framework is complete we will be able to allow students anywhere to
complete the automatically-graded portions of the OS/161 assignments for
free. Eventually we also hope that http://www.ops-class.org[ops-class.org]
will serve as a model for how to deliver computer science course content
online. Unlike similar frameworks, such as
[.spelling_exception]#http://www.edx.org[EdX]#,
http://www.ops-class.org[ops-class.org] is targeted at users with a much
greater comfort level at user computers to create and manage online content.

For those interested, the following video provides an overview of the process
of submitting and grading assignments using
http://www.ops-class.org[ops-class.org] and hints at what could be possible
if this approach is expanded:
