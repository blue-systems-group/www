//
Wifi is common and important way that wireless devices access the internet.
//
Wifi networks, however, are difficult to manage.
//
Home deployments are typically completely unplanned resulting in unnecessary
interference and performance degradation.
//
Most home Wifi users have no idea how to optimize the settings of their own
routers.
//
Even enterprise deployments must content with interference from co-located
networks that may be separately or independently administered.
//
Data gathered from Android smartphones may hold the key to finding order in
this chaos.
//
Based on link:/papers/infocom2016-scans/[promising results from previous
studies] on link:/projects/phonelab[PhoneLab], OptiWifi is building a
complete Wifi scan collection and analysis stack.
//
Our goal is to help individuals and small businesses manage and improve the
performance of their wireless networks.

[.pullquote]#Our key insight is that Android devices already collect and
expose a great deal of information about Wifi networks.#
//
Android smartphones frequently and continuously scan their surroundings and
record the presence and signal strength of nearby wireless access points.
//
These channel scans allow the device to connect to networks that it has
access to, roam between access points as the user moves, and use access point
proximity to estimate the device's location using Google's Wifi access point
location database.

Currently this valuable information about Wifi deployments is immediately
discarded.
//
The OptiWifi Android library and data analysis stack will collect these
scans, upload them to a central point for processing while the device is
charging, and use the data they contain to provide analytics to individuals
and wireless network operators.
//
We plan to build out several simple wireless configuration apps on top of the
OptiWifi library.
//
It can also be easily added to other apps to support new "bring your own app"
approaches.

Key to our approach is the utility of _client-side_ (as opposed to
infrastructure-side) measurements.
//
Most enterprise Wifi networks and even some home access points will attempt
to optimize their settings based on their view of the surrounding wireless
environment.
//
Unfortunately, our link:/papers/infocom2016-scans/[previous work] has
demonstrated that reliance on infrastructure-side measurements can lead to
poor performance.
//
For example, an access point may adjust its channel to avoid interfering with
a neighboring access point even if no clients would be affected by the
interference.
//
Client-side measurements improve the performance of infrastructure-side
measurements and may be all that is available depending on the wireless
hardware being used.
