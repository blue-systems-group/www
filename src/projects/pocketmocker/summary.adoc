Smartphone apps are already able to determine a great deal about us through
passive observation, and as smartphone usage becomes more pervasive and
analytical approaches that fuse data from multiple sensors improve,
smartphones may reveal fundamental things about us: the strength of our
friendships, the health of our lifestyle, and our level of happiness. *With
the digital portraits smartphones can paint becoming more clear, we believe
it is time to give users more control over their smartphone-derived digital
identities.*

While many projects on smartphone security focus on trying to preserve user
privacy, we investigated a different approach. Instead of focusing on
privacy, we improved control by using synthetic or "mocked" data to
manipulate data-driven analytics as directed by the user. In contrast to
privacy, which aims to limit access to data, mocking reduces the percentage
of legitimate data by injecting false data to achieve user-defined
objectives: to seem more active, more social, or wealthier.

Eventually, through modifications to the Android platform, our approach was
able to feed mocked data to unsuspecting apps. The video that follows
demonstrates a mocking session of a GPS-based mapping app called

is stationary, yet the app believes that the user is walking around our
