//
Smartphone battery consumption remains a top concern of smartphone users and
a critical constraint limiting the effectiveness of adoption of smartphone
apps.
//
Due to leakage current, device temperature has a large impact on processor
and overall smartphone energy efficiency.
//
The effect of temperature is exacerbated by the widespread deployment of
multi-core smartphones.
//
Mobile multi-core processors can begin to overheat quickly--within a few
seconds--causing cores to be shut down and work to be lost.
//
We are developing a new framework to manage device temperature at both short,
medium, and long timescales, improving battery lifetime and increasing device
energy efficiency by maintaining efficient operating temperatures.

Based on data collected from the link:/projects/phonelab[PhoneLab smartphone
testbed] we have identified several core problems and opportunities in
smartphone thermal management.
//
First, poor interaction between core activation and CPU frequency selection
decisions on Linux causes frequent thermal emergencies on Android devices.
//
When one or more cores reaches a certain temperature, it must be shut down
and cool before it can be restarted.
//
Given the amount of cycles that are lost during the cooling period, it is
more effective to preemptively lower the CPU frequency and avoid thermal
emergencies altogether.

Second, the fact that the device acts as a small heat sink creates an
opportunity for medium-term thermal planning.
//
This is similar to the idea of
http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~twenisch/papers/hpca12-sprint.pdf[computational
sprinting] but at longer timescales--seconds rather than milliseconds--that
create new challenges.
//
Note that on modern multi-core smartphones most CPU configurations will cause
overheating--frequently within a few seconds.
//
So this form of computational "middle distance running" does not require
running cores outside of their normal operating range or the presence of
special materials providing thermal capacitance.

Finally, the fact that mobile smartphones move through a variety of thermal
environments creates an opportunity for long-term thermal scheduling of
delay-tolerant tasks.
//
For example, app updates may be best to perform when the device is in a
well-cooled environment rather than in a hot car or pocket.
//
Realizing a service to intelligently manage long-term thermal scheduling
addressing the fact that most smartphones do not have an ambient temperature
sensor.
