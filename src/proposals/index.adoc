*link:/[blue] depends on public funding to continue our research and
educational missions.* We are grateful to American taxpayers for their
financial support, and also thankful for the support we have received from
http://www.google.com[Google] and the excellent working relationship we have
with http://www.sprint.com[Sprint].

We strive to be responsible stewards of the public trust that has been placed
in us. As part of this goal, we have chosen to make details of our funded
grant proposals available below. Proposal PDFs contain all the science
content provided to reviewers, but do not include the proposal budget and
other supporting documents (facilities statement, investigator biographies,
etc.) We also hope that other young faculty members may find these documents
helpful as examples of funded proposals.
