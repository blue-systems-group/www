//
*link:/[blue] depends on public funding to continue our research and
educational missions.*
//
We are grateful to American taxpayers for their financial support.
//
We are also thankful support we have received from
http://www.google.com[Google] and the excellent relationship we have with
http://www.sprint.com[Sprint].

We strive to be responsible stewards of the public trust that has been placed
in us.
//
As part of this goal, we have chosen to make details of our funded grant
proposals available below.
//
Proposal PDFs contain all the science content provided to reviewers, but omit
budgets and other supporting documents.
//
We also hope that other faculty members may find these documents helpful as
examples of funded proposals.
